            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>What is mission? I think  mission means achieve our aim.It would be very difficult for all. But everyone should stay focused towards to finish their mission.Most of the people can't achieve it because they didn't stay and if you work hard you can.Mission statement core activities and tangible objectives today</p>

            <h3>Vission</h3>
            <p>What is vision? I think vission means what allows you to see the world around you. You have vision thanks to several components within your eye and brain that work together.Vision statement reason for being now and in the future</p>

        <div class="mission" id="goal">

            <h1>Develop</h1>
            <h1>Without Limit</h1>
            <p>Develop means increase themself using their skills.Its haven't should limit.If you have a limitation to do something you could not achieve properly.In human life there is no end to knowing. If you want to learn something you will develop your life some lillte.And if you learn more you will develop yourself more.So I think should not have limit to develop</p>
